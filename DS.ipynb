    "# What is a Data Structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "In CS, Data is king and when dealing with large number of number, you need a way to safely store them in such a way that you can access them quickly. Thus, people figured out various ways to store, fetch and edit data in the quickest way possible. It helps us manage our computing resources as effective as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Okay, but why is it so important? \n",
    "\n",
    "### Effective:\n",
    "Using Data Structures to store data is very effective and since certain tasks will perform way better when handled using certain data structures. For example, if you were to handle the marks of all the students in your entire university and have to find the average mark of your university. Having the answer sheets piled up on your table would be very bulky to manage and calcalute the marks. Whereas just having the ID of the student and their marks on an excel sheet would be far better. In this task, the data stored in all of those answer sheets can be used to find the average. But differnt way of storing the same information will aid the task to be completed in mere secounds.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you can save your energy and time (i.e resources) when using the right data structure for the right task.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalability: \n",
    "Imainge the same situtaion of finding the average. What if 300 students didn't attend the exam and then university conducted retest for them and then you have another 300 answer sheets on your desk to calcalute, wouldn't that be frustrating? If using excel, it's just 300 more rows and you can still use the same method and complete the task. So when your data is getting bigger and bigger over them, the right data structure should still be able to handle the task as effective as possible. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Real World Application: \n",
    "Every application and process in any of your device would have some sort of data in them and all of those data are stored by some structured method. Finding which data structure to use for which task is cruical because it could end up making a huge difference as we learnt for the example. Thus, learning the pros, cons and the implementation along with their applications of the most used data structures is necessary. "

    "Imagine a stack of books on your table right now. Each book is an element in your stack, and each element have some infomation/data in them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you were to add a book, you're going to add it to the top. And if you're going to remove a book, you're going to remove from the top. \n",

    "\n",
    "## What can you do with this? \n",
    "\n",
    "Well, you can add an element, and remove an element the stack. You can also take a peek at the top most element in the stack and check if the stack is empty or is all filled up. \n",
