Both would give you the same results, but the way which you handled that task is way different and the time and resources which you spent for that task is also way different. That's what having the right algorithm for the right task allows you to perform. \n",

So based on what DS you are using, you could implement any known algorithm that is proven to work or create your own from scratch (or you could refer other similar algorithms and draw inspiration from that). But for all that to happen, you gotta know your algorithms first. There are different types of algorithms such as recurvise/backtracking, dynamic and much much more. So, let's get to that!!!"
